- Consider toggling window visibility after clicking a character button
  - This UX might be bad if the user wants to copy another character shortly after, they will have to re-show the window
- Look into if it's possible to blur the window after clicking a character (or possibly hitting hotkey) then re-focusing previous
  app window and using the https://github.com/kwhat/libuiohook/ library to send the "Ctrl + V" keyboard input to paste the character 
  directly into the previous app
