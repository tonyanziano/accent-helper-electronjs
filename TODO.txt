- Consider toggling window visibility after clicking a character button
  - This UX might be bad if the user wants to copy another character shortly after, they will have to re-show the window
  - Might be possible to use a pop-up menu with only the characters for a specific letter when pressing a keybind
    - ex. User presses "~ + A" and a menu with only the accented A characters pops up, clicking one copies to clipboard and then closes the menu
- Look into if it's possible to blur the window after clicking a character (or possibly hitting hotkey) then re-focusing previous
  app window and using the https://github.com/kwhat/libuiohook/ library to send the "Ctrl + V" keyboard input to paste the character 
  directly into the previous app
    - need to call Windows SendInput() function (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-sendinput)
    - can look at Windows CharMap for unicode value of each special character
- Settings page?
  - Light mode
  - Change keybinds?
