- Consider toggling window visibility after clicking a character button
  - This UX might be bad if the user wants to copy another character shortly after, they will have to re-show the window
  - Might be possible to use a pop-up menu with only the characters for a specific letter when pressing a keybind
    - ex. User presses "~ + A" and a menu with only the accented A characters pops up, clicking one copies to clipboard and then closes the menu
- Settings page?
  - Light mode
  - Change keybinds?
